# Course Project for Coursera Course - Getting and cleaning data
This folder is for the Course Project for Coursera Course, Getting and cleaning data.

## About Getting and Cleaning data
Getting and Cleaning Data focuses on preparing for collecting and cleaning data for downstream analysis and sharing. 

One of the major components of a data scientist's job is to collect and clean data. Whether at a small organization or a major enterprise, the first step in using data is getting, cleaning and understanding the data. In this course we will focus on R packages and a few outside tools that can be used to collect data from a variety of sources, from Excel files to databases like MySQL. We will also cover a variety of formats including JSON, XML, and flat files (.csv, .txt). 

The emphasis of this course is on creating tidy data sets that can be used in downstream analyses. Once you have mastered the material in this course you will be ready to learn about the techniques for exploring, analyzing, and summarizing data offered through our courses track or other Statistics, Data Science, or Machine Learning MOOCs. 


## Brief Introduction on Course Project
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
